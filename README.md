# WNV California Forecasting Challenge 2026

This is the data repository for the 2026 CDPH West Nile virus Forecasting Challenge. This is an open (*by request*) forecasting challenge to predict monthly West Nile virus (WNV) total disease cases in select California counties in 2026 in the months of *May* through *December*.

* **Dates**: The Challenge Period will begin April 2026 and will run until October 2026. Participants are currently asked to submit forecasts by: *April 30th*, *May 31*, *June 30*, *July 31*, *August 31*, *September 30*, and *October 31* (herein referred to as the Forecast Due Dates). All submissions should include forecasts for all remaining months of 2025 (through December).

* **Prediction Targets**: Participants need to submit the `quantile` distribution of cases in each region-month over the whole WNV, along with the `cdf` point probability of zero cases on the same spatiotemporal scale. Please refer to our [targets guide](https://github.com/cdphmodeling/wnvca-2025/tree/main/model-output#output_type) for more information.
